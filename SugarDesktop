Currently Sugar is lacking when compared with a Desktop Environment; 

It works in non standard ways:

* Non standard startup notification
* No way to launch desktop applications
* No (simple) way to access the Journal from filesystem
* No notification area
* Notification system needs work
* Sugar doesn't use the system wallpaper
